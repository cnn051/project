# Design Phase

## Purpose

The Design phase establishes the security architecture and controls for the Maritime Network Management System (NMS). This document outlines the security design principles, architecture, and control specifications that will guide the implementation phase.

## Security Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

The Maritime NMS follows a multi-tier architecture with the following security considerations:

1. **Presentation Tier (UI)**
   - Input validation for all user inputs
   - Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation
   - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection
   - Output encoding to prevent XSS attacks

2. **Application Tier (Business Logic)**
   - Role-based access control enforcement
   - Session management
   - Security event logging
   - Input sanitization
   - API security controls

3. **Data Tier (Database)**
   - Data encryption for sensitive information
   - Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
   - Database access control
   - Data integrity checks

### Authentication and Authorization Design

1. **Authentication**
   - Password-based authentication with strong hashing (Werkzeug's generate_password_hash)
   - Optional multi-factor authentication
   - Protection against brute force attacks
   - Secure session management
   - Authentication logging

2. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control model with three primary roles:
     - Administrator: Full system access
     - Operator: Operational access without administrative functions
     - Read-Only: View-only access to system data
   - Attribute-based access control for specific resources
   - Least privilege principle implementation

### Data Protection Design

1. **Data Classification**
   - Critical: Authentication credentials, private keys
   - Sensitive: Vessel security configurations, alert data
   - Internal: Asset inventory, general vessel data
   - Public: Non-sensitive system documentation

2. **Data Encryption**
   - TLS/SSL for all communications
   - Password hashing using secure algorithms
   - Encryption for sensitive data at rest
   - Integrity validation for transmitted data

3. **Data Flow Security**
   - Secure data transmission between tiers
   - Input validation at each boundary
   - Integrity validation for critical data exchanges
   - Secure API communication design

### Security Control Design

1. **Authentication Controls**
   - Login form with CSRF protection
   - Password complexity enforcement
   - Account lockout after failed attempts
   - Session timeout mechanisms
   - Secure password reset process

2. **Authorization Controls**
   - Permission checking for all protected resources
   - Secure URL access control
   - Function-level access control
   - Data-level access control

3. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Comprehensive security event logging
   - Critical event alerting
   - Timestamps for all log entries
   - Log storage capacity management
   - Log integrity protection

4. **Security Zone Implementation**
   - Logical separation of security zones
   - Visual representation of zone boundaries
   - Controlled data flow between zones
   - Risk-based security controls for each zone

## Security Controls Specification

### Input Validation

All user inputs and API requests will be validated according to the following principles:
- Validation against predefined schemas
- Whitelist-based validation approach
- Type checking and conversion
- Maximum length enforcement
- Context-specific validation rules

### Output Encoding

All dynamic outputs will be encoded according to:
- Context-appropriate encoding (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, URL)
- Template-based rendering with automatic encoding
- Prevention of content-type manipulation
- Character set controls

### Session Management

Session security will be implemented with:
- Secure, random session identifiers
- Server-side session storage
- HTTPS-only cookies
- Session timeout and idle timeout
- Session invalidation on logout

### Error Handling and Logging

Secure error handling will include:
- Generic error messages to users
- Detailed errors logged for administrators
- Prevention of information leakage
- Appropriate error response codes
- Consistent error handling framework

## Security Design Patterns

The Maritime NMS implements the following security design patterns:

1. **Security Model**
   - Secure by design approach
   - Defense in depth strategy
   - Least privilege principle
   - Complete mediation for access control

2. **Authentication Patterns**
   - Centralized authentication service
   - Authentication proxy for API access
   - Credential lifecycle management
   - Session-based authentication for web interface

3. **Access Control Patterns**
   - Reference monitor pattern
   - Role-based access control
   - Permission-based access control
   - Interceptor pattern for authorization checks

4. **Logging Patterns**
   - Centralized logging service
   - Event correlation
   - Secure log storage
   - Log analysis patterns

## Threat Countermeasures

This section maps specific countermeasures to the threats identified during the Requirements phase:

| Threat | Countermeasure | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Unauthorized Access | Multi-factor authentication | Optional MFA for user accounts |
| Data Tampering | Integrity validation | HMAC-based integrity verification |
| Information Disclosure | Data encryption | TLS for transmission, hash for storage |
| Denial of Service | Rate limiting | API rate limiting implementation |
| Privilege Escalation | Least privilege | Role-based access with minimal permissions |
| Repudiation | Comprehensive logging | Secure audit logs with timestamps |
| SQL Injection | Parameterized queries | SQLAlchemy ORM with parameter binding |
| Cross-Site Scripting | Output encoding | Template-based rendering with auto-escaping |

## Security Interface Design

The following interfaces have specific security considerations:

1. **User Interface**
   - Secure login form
   - Security zone visualization
   - Alert management interface
   - Role-appropriate views

2. **API Interface**
   - Authentication requirements
   - Rate limiting
   - Input validation
   - Response security headers

3. **Database Interface**
   - Connection pooling
   - Prepared statements
   - Minimal privilege database users
   - Connection encryption
