# Verification Phase

## Purpose

The Verification phase ensures that the implemented Maritime Network Management System (NMS) meets all security requirements and is free of vulnerabilities. This document outlines the testing methodologies, procedures, and acceptance criteria used to verify the security of the system.

## Security Testing Methodology

### Testing Approach

The Maritime NMS security verification follows a comprehensive testing strategy:

1. **Defensive Testing**: Verifying that security controls work as designed
2. **Offensive Testing**: Actively attempting to find and exploit vulnerabilities
3. **Compliance Testing**: Ensuring adherence to KR GC-44-K and IACS requirements
4. **Continuous Testing**: Security testing throughout the development lifecycle

### Testing Types

1. **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**
   - Code review
   - Static code analysis
   - Dependency scanning
   - Software composition analysis

2. **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - Penetration testing
   - Fuzz testing
   - API security testing

3. **Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)**
   - Runtime security analysis
   - Security instrumentation
   - Real-time vulnerability detection

4. **Security Compliance Testing**
   - Requirements traceability testing
   - Regulatory compliance verification
   - Control effectiveness assessment

## Security Testing Tools

The following tools are used for security verification:

1. **Static Analysis Tools**
   - Bandit: Python code security scanner
   - ESLint (with security plugins): JavaScript code analysis
   - SonarQube: Code quality and security scanner
   - Safety: Python dependency checker

2. **Dynamic Analysis Tools**
   - OWASP ZAP: Web application security scanner
   - Burp Suite: Web vulnerability scanner
   - API Security Testing: Postman with security tests
   - Network scanning: Nmap, Nessus

3. **Compliance Testing Tools**
   - Requirements traceability matrix
   - Custom compliance checkers for KR GC-44-K
   - Security control verification checklist

   - Verify zone visualization accuracy
   - Test zone-based access controls

2. **Vessel Asset Management Security Testing**
   - Verify asset inventory security
   - Test asset relationship integrity
   - Verify asset data protection
   - Test asset update security

3. **Alert Management Security Testing**
   - Verify alert generation security
   - Test alert acknowledgment controls
   - Verify alert resolution security
   - Test alert logging integrity

## Vulnerability Management Process

The following process is followed for handling identified vulnerabilities:

1. **Vulnerability Identification**
   - Discovery through testing
   - Risk assessment
   - CVSS scoring
   - Priority assignment

2. **Vulnerability Documentation**
   - Detailed description
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Evidence (screenshots, logs)

3. **Vulnerability Remediation**
   - Developer assignment
   - Fix implementation
   - Peer review
   - Verification testing

4. **Vulnerability Tracking**
   - Status monitoring
   - Remediation timeline
   - Regression testing
   - Closing verification

## Security Acceptance Criteria

For a release to be approved, it must meet the following security acceptance criteria:

1. **Zero Critical or High Vulnerabilities**
   - No critical vulnerabilities
   - No high-risk vulnerabilities
   - Documented mitigation for any medium vulnerabilities

2. **Compliance Requirements**
   - 100% compliance with KR GC-44-K mandatory requirements
   - 100% compliance with IACS UR E26/E27 mandatory requirements
   - Documentation of any compensating controls

3. **Test Coverage**
   - Minimum 80% code coverage for security-relevant code
   - 100% testing of security controls
   - All security use cases tested
