프롬프트 1 (새로운 Repl 생성 시):
Create a new Python Repl. I am developing a Network Management System (NMS) server for maritime vessels, specifically adhering to the Korean Register's "Guidance for Cyber Resilience of Ships and Systems (GC-44-K, 2024)" which incorporates IACS UR E26 and E27.

The NMS server will monitor ship systems, provide real-time data visualization, and manage alerts. I plan to use Flask for the web server and PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy for data storage.

Based on Chapter 2 ("Ship Cyber Resilience") and Chapter 3 ("Cyber Resilience of Onboard Systems and Equipment") of the provided guidance, suggest an initial project structure. Specifically, consider:
1.  **Vessel Asset Inventory (KR GC-44-K, 2.401.1):** How to structure data for tracking hardware, software, versions, and network interfaces for all onboard Computer Based Systems (CBS).
2.  **Security Zones and Network Segmentation (KR GC-44-K, 2.402.1):** How to conceptually represent security zones and conduits.
3.  **Required Security Capabilities (KR GC-44-K, 3.401):** Suggest initial database models and API considerations for handling data related to authentication, access control, malware protection, logging, and communication integrity as outlined in Table 3.4.1.
4.  **Secure Development Life Cycle (SDLC) (KR GC-44-K, 3.501):** Advise on a project structure that can accommodate documentation and processes for secure development practices.

Provide basic Flask boilerplate with placeholders for these components.

2단계: 데이터베이스 모델 및 지침 요구사항 반영
프롬프트 2 (데이터베이스 모델 정의 - 심화):
Refine the PostgreSQL database models using SQLAlchemy, focusing on the detailed requirements from KR GC-44-K.

1.  **Vessel Asset Inventory (2.401.1):** Create models for `Vessel` and `CBSAsset`. For `CBSAsset`, include fields to capture:
    * Hardware components: name, brand/manufacturer, model/type, brief function/purpose, physical interfaces (e.g., network, serial), system software name/type (OS, firmware), version, patch level, supported communication protocols.
    * Software components: installed hardware component, brand/manufacturer, model/type, brief function/purpose, software version.
    * Link CBSAssets to `SecurityZone` and `Vessel`.
2.  **Alerts & Logging (2.403.1, 3.401, Item 13-16):** Define an `Alert` model and a `SecurityLog` model. `SecurityLog` should capture:
    * Timestamp.
    * Event type (e.g., access control, OS events, backup/recovery, configuration changes, communication loss).
    * CBS involved.
    * Description of the event.
    * Ensure the `SecurityLog` model supports "audit record storage capacity" (3.401, Item 14) and "timestamp" (3.401, Item 16) requirements.
3.  **Access Control & Authentication (3.401, Item 1-6, 8):** Define a `User` model with fields for:
    * `username`, `hashed_password`.
    * `role` (e.g., administrator, operator, read-only), linked to "least privilege principle" (2.402.4.2.(바)).
    * Consider fields for multi-factor authentication status if applicable (3.402, Item 31).
4.  **Security Zones (2.402.1):** Create a `SecurityZone` model to logically group CBS, including a `name` and `description`.
5.  **Compensation Measures (3.104.4):** How can the database schema allow for tracking "compensating countermeasures" for specific security requirements that cannot be fully met by an inherent security feature? Suggest a mechanism within the models.

Generate the SQLAlchemy model definitions and basic database initialization code.

3단계: 데이터 수집 API 및 지침 기반 검증 로직
프롬프트 3 (데이터 수신 API 및 보안 검증):
Implement a Flask API endpoint `/api/sensor_data` to receive sensor data from vessels. This endpoint must incorporate validation and processing logic based on KR GC-44-K requirements, particularly related to `Integrity` and `Confidentiality` (3.401, Item 17, 21).

1.  **Data Structure:** The endpoint should accept POST requests with JSON data including `vessel_id`, `cbs_id`, `sensor_type`, `value`, `timestamp`, and potentially `integrity_hash` or `encryption_status`.
2.  **Integrity Protection (3.401, Item 17, 3.402, Item 38):** Implement a mechanism to verify the integrity of received sensor data. If a `integrity_hash` is provided, validate it. If not, suggest a placeholder for future integrity checks.
3.  **Confidentiality Protection (3.401, Item 21, 3.402, Item 39):** Advise on how the NMS server could handle encrypted data if received from vessels, and suggest a placeholder for decryption if required. Note the requirement for encryption in wireless networks.
4.  **Logging (3.401, Item 13-16):** Ensure that successful data reception and any validation failures are logged to the `SecurityLog` model, including timestamps.
5.  **Fallback (2.404.4):** While data reception is active, suggest how the NMS could conceptually identify if a "cyber incident impairs the ability of a CBS or network to provide intended services" and trigger a `fallback to minimum risk state`. This can be a conceptual logging or alert.

Provide the Flask route code with necessary validation and logging.

4단계: 웹 대시보드 및 실시간 모니터링 (보안 구역, 알림)
프롬프트 4 (웹 대시보드 및 시각화 - 보안 구역 및 알림 강화):
Enhance the Flask web dashboard (`/`) to visualize vessel data and manage alerts, directly reflecting the KR GC-44-K requirements.

1.  **Security Zones Visualization (2.402.1):** Design the dashboard to conceptually display vessels and their CBSs organized by "Security Zones" as per the "Zone and Conduit Diagram" (2.402.1.4.(가)). Suggest how to present this on the UI, perhaps with different sections or interactive elements.
2.  **Real-time Data & Alerts (2.403.1, 3.401, Item 13, 2.404.1):**
    * Display the latest sensor data, categorized by `CBSAsset` and `SecurityZone`.
    * Integrate a section for "alerts" from the `Alert` model, showing their status and type.
    * Implement a mechanism to trigger alerts based on predefined thresholds (e.g., engine temperature exceeding 90°C), and ensure these alerts are logged to the `SecurityLog` model.
    * Suggest a basic real-time update mechanism (e.g., AJAX polling or a placeholder for WebSockets later).
3.  **Access Control (2.402.4):** Ensure the dashboard has a basic login page, and that different functionalities (e.g., viewing sensitive logs, managing users) are restricted based on `User` roles (e.g., "administrator" vs. "read-only"). Implement a basic Flask-Login integration.
4.  **Incident Response Plan (2.404.1):** Add a conceptual area on the dashboard or an administrative page that allows administrators to view and manage incident response procedures (e.g., acknowledging an alert, triggering an isolation procedure). This doesn't need to implement the full procedure, but represent its interface.

Provide the updated Flask routes, HTML templates, and CSS for a basic, responsive dashboard.

5단계: 유지보수 및 보안 개발 수명주기 (SDLC) 문서화
프롬프트 5 (SDLC 및 유지보수 계획 문서화):
Outline a plan for documenting the NMS server's adherence to the Secure Development Life Cycle (SDLC) requirements and ongoing maintenance as specified in KR GC-44-K (Chapter 3, Section 5, and 2.401.1.(5)). This won't involve writing the full documentation, but rather the structure and content.

1.  **SDLC Document Structure (3.501.2):** Propose a directory structure within the Repl for SDLC documentation, including:
    * Requirements Analysis.
    * Design.
    * Implementation.
    * Verification.
    * Release.
    * Maintenance.
    * End-of-Life.
2.  **Key SDLC Requirements (3.502):** For each of these phases, briefly describe what specific documentation related to the NMS server would be included, referencing the following items:
    * `Private Key Control` (3.502.1).
    * `Security Update Documentation` (3.502.2).
    * `Dependent Component Security Update Documentation` (3.502.3).
    * `Security Update Provision` (3.502.4).
    * `Product Defense in Depth` (3.502.5).
    * `Expected Defense in Depth Measures in the Environment` (3.502.6).
    * `Security Hardening Guidance` (3.502.7).
3.  **Vessel Asset Inventory Maintenance (2.401.1.(5)):** Describe how the NMS server's own asset inventory (hardware/software components used in the NMS itself) will be maintained and updated within this SDLC framework.
4.  **Software Update Management (2.401.1.(5)):** Explain how the process for managing software updates and patches for the NMS server (both for its own components and for future managed CBSs) would be documented to meet the guidance.

Provide a conceptual markdown document or a set of prompts for generating these documents.

6단계: 추가 고려사항 및 심화 기능 (지침 4장)
프롬프트 6 (사이버보안관리시스템 추가 요구사항 - 선택적):
Consider the additional requirements for a "Ship Cybersecurity Management System" as outlined in KR GC-44-K, Chapter 4. While this chapter applies upon shipowner's request, outline how the NMS server could support these requirements, making it ready for a "Cyber Resilience (Managed)" class notation (4.102.2).

1.  **Cyber Risk Management Process (4.202):** How can the NMS server facilitate the identification, analysis, assessment, and treatment of cyber risks for onboard CBS and networks? Suggest features such as:
    * Displaying identified internal/external cyber threats.
    * Integrating risk assessment results (e.g., displaying risk levels for different CBSs).
    * Tracking improvement actions based on risk prioritization.
2.  **Awareness and Training (4.203):** How could the NMS provide or link to resources for crew awareness and training on cybersecurity? (e.g., a "resources" tab with links to guidelines, or logging of training completion).
3.  **Incident Response and Recovery Support (4.204):** Beyond basic alert display, how could the NMS actively support the incident response and recovery processes (e.g., quick access to emergency contact lists, incident reporting templates, or backup status views)?
4.  **Internal Audit Support (4.205):** How can the NMS aid in "internal audits" of ship cybersecurity management (e.g., providing audit logs, configuration baselines, or reporting on compliance with security policies)?
